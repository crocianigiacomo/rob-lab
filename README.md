# rob-lab

Small University project carried out in collaboration with two colleagues during my Erasmus a madrid period for the robotics course.

These are two codes in C that served to control the engine and sensors connected to a raspberry mounted on a wooden case to simulate a vehicle.

Objective:

Follow a path marked with a black line on the ground and hate objects if it encounters them head-on.
